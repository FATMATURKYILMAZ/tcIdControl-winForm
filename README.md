##As can be seen on the side, it is an interface that checks a simple Id, name, surname, date of birth written in c#. SOAP web service is used here. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)** is a protocol used to communicate between web-based services. SOAP is an XML (Extensible Markup Language) based messaging format and enables data exchange using various communication protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP.

SOAP provides a web service communication model that can exchange structured data between server and client. In this model, a client can make a request to a server-side service using SOAP messages and receive a response from the server. SOAP messages are encoded in XML format and sent from client to server or from server to client.

SOAP messages consist of two basic parts, the header and the body. The header section contains additional information such as message routing, authentication, error checking, while the body section contains the actual data shared between client and server.

SOAP web services are platform independent, meaning they can communicate between different programming languages ​​and operating systems. Therefore, they can be preferred to exchange data between systems with different technologies.

**SOAP enables web services to share more complex and structured data. SOAP messages can also be defined through WSDL (Web Services Description Language) documents, so details such as web services functions, parameters and data types can be documented automatically.**

In recent years, REST (Representational State Transfer) based web services are preferred over SOAP based web services. RESTful services offer a lighter, simpler, and generally easier to use approach. However, in some cases, SOAP web services are still used, especially in projects that require integration with existing SOAP-based systems.
